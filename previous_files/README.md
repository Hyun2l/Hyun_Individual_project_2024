Title : Impact of Weather Conditions on Lap time in Formula 1

Impact of Weather Conditions of racing performance: A Machine Learning Approach

Abstract idea : 
How?:  Start from basic features that affect on lap time, by increment number of the weather features(rainfall, track temparatu, etc), analyze increasing accuracy of the lap time corresponds to the factors, build a ML model that predict lap time based on weather conditions / forcast


Objectives:
* Primary Goal: To develop a robust ML framework that accurately predicts lap times, considering the influence of diverse weather conditions.
* To analyze and predict how different weather conditions affect racing performance, specifically lap times
* Secondary Goals: Enhance understanding of environmental impacts on racing, improve race strategy planning, and contribute to sports analytics and data science fields.
